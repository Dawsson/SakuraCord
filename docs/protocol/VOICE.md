# Voice, streams and soundboard

[Protocol index](../PROTOCOL_BASELINE.md)

## Owners and checks

Main-Gateway intent is built by
[DiscordGatewayPayloadFactory](../../Packages/DiscordProtocol/Sources/DiscordProtocol/DiscordGatewaySupport.swift);
[DiscordVoiceSession](../../Packages/MediaPipeline/Sources/MediaPipeline/DiscordVoiceSession.swift)
owns media negotiation/lifecycle. Stream state lives in
[DiscordApplicationStreams.swift](../../Packages/DiscordProtocol/Sources/DiscordProtocol/DiscordApplicationStreams.swift);
[ScreenShareCaptureEngine](../../Packages/MediaPipeline/Sources/MediaPipeline/ScreenShareCaptureEngine.swift)
owns native capture. [DiscordRESTSoundboard.swift](../../Packages/DiscordProtocol/Sources/DiscordProtocol/DiscordRESTSoundboard.swift)
owns soundboard requests.

Representative verification:
[VoiceConnectionTests.swift](../../Packages/MediaPipeline/Tests/MediaPipelineTests/VoiceConnectionTests.swift),
[VoiceGatewayProtocolTests.swift](../../Packages/MediaPipeline/Tests/MediaPipelineTests/VoiceGatewayProtocolTests.swift),
[VoiceTransportTests.swift](../../Packages/MediaPipeline/Tests/MediaPipelineTests/VoiceTransportTests.swift) and
[SoundboardTests.swift](../../App/Tests/SakuraCordAppTests/SoundboardTests.swift).

## Control planes and recovery

The main Gateway owns channel membership, calls and stream discovery. A Voice
connection owns call media; each selected screen stream has a separate Voice
allocation. A stream stop must not leave the enclosing call. Match voice-server,
state and stream updates to the owning account/session before installing them.

Negotiate transport, codecs and DAVE through MediaPipeline. UDP discovery and
provisional connection setup are bounded and clean up on failure; they cannot
leave an indefinite connecting state. Voice timeout `4009` identifies again.
Invalid/displaced or server-directed sessions (`4006`, `4014`, `4021`, `4022`)
tear down local media without publishing a main-Gateway leave that could disconnect
another client now owning the account's voice session. Other transient closures
use bounded resume. Device changes preserve the active session where possible.

## Private calls

`CALL_CREATE`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`, guildless voice states and `ongoing_rings` track
calls app-wide. Moving a user between calls first removes them from the old call.
A selected/joined private call subscribes with opcode 13 once per channel/session.
Joining sends main opcode 4 with nullable guild and the current mute/deafen/video
state, then negotiates Voice from pushed own-state/server events.

Starting a DM call first reads `/channels/{channel}/call`. Join voice, wait for
pushed call creation and ring once only when the readiness response is ringable.
A group-DM start skips that read. Joining an existing call sends no readiness
read or ring. An empty snapshot with no participants/rings is not an existing call.
Decline posts stop-ringing for the current recipient without joining.
Ring/stop-ringing mutations have one attempt; a later ring failure must not repeat
a successful media join. A null-channel opcode 4 leaves the call.

## Screen sharing

Stream keys identify guild/call, channel and owner. Main-Gateway create/watch/
delete/ping/pause operations are owned by the payload builders. Discovery and
server-allocation events update one stream store. A null endpoint waits for a
replacement; an unavailable stream retains explicit viewer/broadcaster intent,
pings the allocation and reconnects instead of treating it as a final stop.

A connected one-to-one DM initially auto-watches a discovered remote stream;
GDM and guild streams require explicit Watch. Stopping watching keeps the call
connected. Preview reads are lightweight and do not imply a broadcast upload.

Stream Voice Identify advertises a `screen` RID; the later media advertisement
uses `video`. Source quality uses semantic zero dimensions with `type:source`,
while the encoder retains actual capture dimensions; fixed quality advertises
its fixed dimensions. Viewer demand includes quality and rendered pixel counts;
hidden/unwatched streams request zero demand. Optional stream audio uses its
stream connection and Soundshare speaking flag, then plays through the existing
call output graph.

Capture begins only after explicit system-picker selection. Updating source or
quality reconfigures the owned stream; cancel/dismiss/stop/failure releases the
corresponding resources. Keep capture/encoding/delivery bounded. Skip capture
input before encoding under backpressure rather than discarding encoded reference
frames; loss/PLI requests a keyframe. Preserve audio source timing when old queued
frames are dropped. Exact pacing and buffer constants belong to the media code.

## Soundboard

Default sounds come from `/soundboard-default-sounds`; guild catalogues use main
Gateway opcode 31 with bounded deduplicated guild IDs. `SOUNDBOARD_SOUNDS` replaces
that guild's catalogue; create/update/delete dispatches reconcile it. Catalogue
failures are bounded and do not start REST fallback polling. Local preview is a
CDN read with no account mutation.

Native playback posts once to `/channels/{channel}/send-soundboard-sound`, with
sound/emoji fields and a source guild for custom sounds. Enforce current speaking,
soundboard and, where needed, external-sound permissions plus voice-state
restrictions. Self-mute does not block playback and must not be changed by it.
Defaults and same-guild sounds use native delivery. Cross-guild native delivery
requires the applicable entitlement; the app's configured fallback may mix the
sound into existing outgoing audio when allowed.

Local optimistic rendering suppresses its matching Gateway echo. Both supported
voice-effect event names feed the same consumer. CDN decode and outgoing mixing
never create another microphone graph or Voice connection. Self-muted microphone
samples remain zero before mixing. Deafen/output routing applies to local/incoming
playback; teardown and account replacement clear queued audio. Favourites/history
are covered by [synchronized settings](SETTINGS.md#emoji-gifs-stickers-and-sounds).
